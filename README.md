# img-mm

high-level goals:

- uses simple python web app framework (flask?)
- runs from the commandline and is given paths to find images
- launches app in browser
- displays two photos. photos with no ranks are prioritized
- photos are now in a match. you click the winner
- app uses ELO type algo to determine new ranks
- ranks written to file metadata (document format so other apps can work with it)
- no other data store is used
- new photos are displayed
- app should be as responsive as possible to aid speed of use
- you can quit any time while playing
- compatibility with as many brower plugins as possible is desirable (e.g., image zoom plugins)
